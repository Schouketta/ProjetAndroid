# ProjetAndroid
The goal of this project is to deliver a sporting app that would enable coaches to save significant informations about matches and debrief objectively using statistics with their players.

Design constraints :

  1- ergonomic interface (use activities, menus, ...) that adapts to landscape and portrait modes, and displays the content in french or english depending on the underlying system configuration

  2- locate the matches (latitude, longitude, ...)

  3- take pictures of the match and save them locally

  4- save statistics locally for 5 previous matches (in a sqlite database)

  5- save full statistics on a real external database

  6- be able to display information about any previous match (read the information from the local databse or the distant one)
